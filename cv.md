### About me  

I am a software developer with five years of experience mostly in banking. Technologies I worked with are Java, Spring, PL/SQL, Oracle Forms/Reports. Main accomplishments include automation of business processes which reduced overall time of manual work, development of OnlineBank webapp allowing our clients perform financial operations wherever they are, support of third-party app which prevented bank from calls to third-party support.  
Now I am interested in front-end development and would like to start from very beginning - HTML and CSS. Combining previous experience with new knowledge in future definitely can be of great benefit.
